# Preenfm3-docs-tools
A modest repository of my tools and documents for Preenfm3. More as a proof of concept, an exercise.

- Docs - wip.
- Renoise tool - PoC can I make a tool that will receive and send values between Renoise and Pfm3. Using the NRPN list I took the ones I needed and suddenly I have a panel with all the operators and envelopes in one place. Happy days
